This module adds an auto computed position on sale order line.
This position number is added on the report.

The position can be used to keep track of each line during
the delivery and invoicing of the order with the customer.
This is why there are related modules on `account-invoice-reporting`
and `stock-logisics-reporting`.

The position is not changed on the line after the order has been send.
