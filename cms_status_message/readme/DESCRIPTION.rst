A "status message" is an important message that you want to show to
users.

For instance: a user submit a form or does a specific action and you
want to report the status of this action like "your profile has been
updated" or "Your upgrade has been successful.".

This module allows to easily display this kind of messages to your
users.

Messages are displayed using Twitter bootstrap alerts.

You can add several messages: they will be displayed one after another.
