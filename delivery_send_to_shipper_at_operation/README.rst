This module allows to send the delivery notification to the carrier when
any operation before the delivery one is marked as done.

This is used mainly to send the notification when the pack operation is marked
as done, using the shipping method of the related delivery operation.
By doing so, the delivery operation won't send again the delivery notification
when it will be validated.
However, the delivery cost will still be added to the sale order by the delivery
operation, not the pack.

Usage
=====

On the shipping method, you can configure on which operation types the
delivery notification is triggered by selecting *Defined operations* in the
*Send delivery notice on* field:

Then select the operation type which will trigger the delivery notification:

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Known issues:

* this module is working fine only if the operation from which the delivery
  note is sent has no backorder. All quantities have to be processed to get
  full data in the delivery notification;

TODO:

* hide the "Send to shipper" button on the delivery form if the delivery
  notification has already been sent
