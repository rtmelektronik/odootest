This module allows to configure a coupon program so the validation is restricted to
eCommerce sales.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Website > Products > Coupon Programs* and choose the one you want to restrict.
#. In the *Validity* group you'll find a check box to choose whether or not this program
   should be restrict to eCommerce sales only.

Usage
=====

If a coupon belongs to a eCommerce restricted program, if a user tries to validate
it from the sale order backend, it will raise an error, disallowing it.

The same coupon will be usable from the eCommerce though.
