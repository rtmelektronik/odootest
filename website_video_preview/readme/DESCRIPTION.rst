Normally when you add a video on your page it will load the entire video player.
This will make your page load more data even when the visitor doesn't watch the video.
When visitors are using their mobile data plan it will unnecessary drain it.
This module prevents this issue by loading a preview image first.

The iframe of the player is loaded only when the user clicks on the preview image.

Currently only YouTube videos are supported.
