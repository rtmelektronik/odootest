To configure the automatic generation of Product Reference, you need to:

#. Go to ``Settings > General Settings``, and check "Product Default Code
   Manual Mask" on "Product Variants" section if you want to manually set
   up mask for each Product Template. If you want to use default mask leave
   the chekbox unchecked.
#. Go to ``Sales > Catalog > Products``, and select a product.
#. On the General Information tab edit the value of the field
   ``Reference Prefix`` for automatic mask creation. The value will be used as
   a delimiter between individual attribute values (codes).
#. If you selected "Product Default Code Manual Mask" in Settings you will be
   able to set up mask for that Product Template.
