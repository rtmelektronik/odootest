If a coupon belongs to a eCommerce restricted program, if a user tries to validate
it from the sale order backend, it will raise an error, disallowing it.

The same coupon will be usable from the eCommerce though.
Configure the promotions as described in the previous section and then place a
quotation that fulfills the rules.

The reward will show up an extra order line, with the price unit of the applicable
pricelist and a discount of 100%.
