To make the connection with Routific we need to create new entries of the Settings model
on Routific. To make this we have to follow the next steps:

  #. Go to *Routific > Settings*
  #. Create a new entry
  #. Set a name
  #. Set your Token Key for establish the connection
  #. Select the allowed operation type for filter the pickings

The default URLs and address format are correct for Routific Platform connection and
geolocatization, but can be changed if they change sometime.

The options on *Project* section are the default settings for all the projects created
with this Settings.

We need to define drivers on our instance. We can follow next steps:

  #. Go to *Contacts*
  #. Create a new one
  #. Check the option **Is driver** at *Routific* section
  #. Check the option **Driver active**

If we want to divide the charge filtering by types of products, we can check at
*Inventory > Configuration > Attributes* what attribute defines the type by checking the
field **Is routific type**. Doing this, now you can select the types allowed by a
driver at Driver's sheet.
